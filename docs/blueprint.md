# **App Name**: Sentinel View

## Core Features:

- Automated Data Collection: Periodically collect container and host system data via SSH.
- Real-Time Status Monitoring: Display container and host system status (uptime, reachability) in real-time.
- Alerting and Error Indication: Highlight failing containers or unreachable servers in red for immediate attention.
- Simple Host and Container Management: Enable easy addition and removal of monitored containers and hosts without complex configuration.
- Single-Screen Display Optimization: Optimize the UI for continuous display on a single 27-inch monitor without mouse/keyboard interaction; information density without navigation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #005050 for a modern and authoritative feel.
- Background color: #ffffff, nearly white, to enhance readability and reduce eye strain.
- Accent color: #8c8c8c to highlight critical alerts and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to maintain a clean, modern, and easily readable interface.
- Use clear and intuitive icons to represent the status of systems at a glance; positive states indicated with green checkmarks, errors in red.
- Maximize information density by using a grid layout and avoiding unnecessary spacing or graphical elements. Arrange containers and hosts in a clear, logical hierarchy.
- Use subtle transitions when status changes occur (e.g., a fade-in effect when a system comes online) to avoid distracting the user.
